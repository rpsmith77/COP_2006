# COP 2006: Intro to Programing
#### FGCU, Spring 2020
## Course Description:
Introductory computer programming concepts and problem-solving skills are learned using a modern programming language. Principles of good programming style are emphasized.
## Learning Objectives:
The student will learn fundamental-to-intermediate programming concepts, including data types, expressions, classes, arrays, methods, conditional statements, loops, and input/output, with application development using the Java object-oriented programming language. Essential skills to decompose, design, and code basic control structures and program modules will also be taught. Specifically, the student will acquire the following outcomes: 
1. Demonstrated an understanding of the domain and principles of high-level programming languages. 
2. Demonstrated an understanding of the programming life cycle, including program development and maintenance/evolution. 
3. Demonstrated the ability to compose programs from requirements expressed in natural language, mathematical notation, or algorithmic description. 
4. Demonstrated an understanding of fundamental programming principles, problem solving, and critical thinking. 
5. Demonstrated an understanding of the syntax and semantics of the basic language constructs, including variables, data types, conditional statements, and iterative constructs. 
6. Demonstrate an understanding of the procedural abstraction and parameter-passing mechanisms. 
7. Demonstrated the ability to develop programs in multiple modules using sound principles, e.g., multiple functions or procedures, and classes or files, as pertaining to development of scalable programs, and to promote reusability and maintainability. 1 A class hour at FGCU is typically 50 minutes to 1 hour and 15 minutes. 
8. Demonstrated the ability to develop programs that use persistent storage (e.g., file I/O), linear data structures (e.g., arrays), and error checking (e.g., exceptional flow). 
9. Demonstrated an understanding of the use of programming styles and documentation, as pertaining to software quality. 
10. Demonstrated the usage of software tool support in the programming process, including composing source code, compilation, testing, debugging, and execution.
